# Team BEJJ Project 3: Usability Report

## Usability Test 1
For this usability test, the user was an architecture student who uses the website to assist himself in building design (Instagram, Pinterest for inspiration). The user noted that he saw the website's color palette as very aesthetically pleasing. Most pages the user said that he was able to clearly see the important sections. In the store page, the user did not see the "Top of Page" button at the bottom right.

## Usability Test 2
This user is an engineering student who primarily utilizes their phone for most of their interactions on the web. They mention a great understanding of what the website service is, especially with the home page being quite clear.

After the user was asked to find certain plants from in the store page, they mentioned a difficulty in finding a pattern to the plant lists. Additionally, they address the naming scheme throughout the items in the store page "confusing" due to the biological name of the plant being used first instead of the nick names. They requested for there to be a way to sort the items to have a more efficient/easy way of browsing.

Lastly, the user pointed out the cart page having too many decimal places when calculating the total sum of what is being charged. The tax calculations that is being done behind the scenes should also be communicated to the customer within the cart page for transparency. 

## Usability Test 3
This user was a product manager on top of being a full time student, providing a unique perspective. Like test 1, this user enjoyed the color scheme of the store and quickly recognized it as a plant store. This user used the "Top of Page" button on the bottom right of the store page, but noted that they would like the store page more if there was a search menu at the top.

The user noted that the payment page does not look professional and secure, but it was clear. Additionally, he showed desire to make the process more clear and to make it easier to know what pages come next. Lastly, they requested for buttons to be made more clear.

## Summary
To summarize some of the feedback gathered from our usability tests, overall, users liked the color scheme and how eye-catching the home page is. In the future we would want to sort the plants to put them in order and possibly include a search function if a user wants to find a specific plant without scrolling and scanning the page for the one they want. Users also expected to have an address input on the "Payment" section of our page. We could possibly include an address input in that section though it would be redundant as it is already on the "Billing" and "Shipping" pages. In the future if we were to conduct more tests we would want to test users on tablets and mobile phones to see how they navigate and experience the website on smaller screen sizes.
Usability Tests are a very good way of getting a feel how your website will function on real life. In the end of the day it is very important to know what the website users experience. The purpose of our website mainly is to be easy to understand and use from our customers. These test showed to us that we still have some changes to do to make this website fully compatible with modern standards of usability. We got very good feedbacks from all 3 Test's users. They all come from different backgrounds and were able to give us feedback based on different prospectives. Usability test it is a very good technique that we are looking forward to use in our future careers.
